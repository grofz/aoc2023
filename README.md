My cool new project!

## Day 01: Trebuchet?!
Recognize "1", "2", ... and "one", "two", ... at the beginning and at the end
of the line. Difficult as the test case for Part 2 did not contain a case as
for example "oneight". Using "scan" and "index" intrinsics.

## Day 02: Cube Conundrum
Parse the clear syntax to the array, Search for maximum values in this array.
Using "split" function.
