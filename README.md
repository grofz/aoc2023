My cool new project!

## Day 01: Trebuchet?!
Recognize "1", "2", ... and "one", "two", ... at the beginning and at the end
of the line. Difficult as the test case for Part 2 did not contain a case as
for example "oneight". Using "scan" and "index" intrinsics.

## Day 02: Cube Conundrum
Parse the clear syntax to the array, Search for maximum values in this array.
Using "split" function.

## Day 03: Gear Ratios
Find text labels in a 2D-array of characters, then search arouond this label
for the presence of particular characters.

## Day 04: Scratchcards
Parse a line of numbers into a pair of arrays. Compare the two arrays.

## Day 05: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer
Map an interval of numbers to another interval using a list of rules, find the minimum value of the new interval. Part 1 to part 2 transition was from processing several points to maping a huge number of points in interval sets.  

## Day 06: Wait For It
Optimize the time needed to "charge" the boat. Part 2 solved by solving the quadratic formula, but brute-force would also work.

## Day 07: Camel Cards
Identify the strength of a hand of cards (flush, pairs, etc.), sort the cards according to their strength. Using OOP. Part 2 introduces the Joker cards and modifies the sorting order.

## Day 08: Haunted Wasteland
Traverse a binary graph until finding a particular node. Part 2 requires one to figure out that the input graph allows to use a least common multiplier approach (all paths are circular)

## Day 09: Mirage Maintenance
Predict the next value in the pattern. Solved by using a recursion and making finite difference of an array of numbers. Part 2 is a trivial modification of Part 1 solution.
